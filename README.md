# Object Detection and coutner (Vhicles Counter on a highway video sequence)
<<<<<<< HEAD

This project demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect, track, and count vehicles in a highway road video. It utilizes the [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/fr/), [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) framework along with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and other relevant libraries. The objective is to perform real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and counting within the video footage, leveraging the capabilities of YOLOv8 for efficient object detection
